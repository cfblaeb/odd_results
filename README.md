A review/data recreating of a recent article with puzzling results

I read this article: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-018-2632-2
but was puzzled by an increase in mRNA not leading to an increase in titer.

So I recreated the data (using https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) and analyzed in jupyter lab to see if I could understand it better then.

I couldnt.

Apparently production stops almost entirely after 48 hours.
